## Blocks

A **block** of text is the most common element. Text blocks include 
paragraphs and blockquotes, as well as preformatted text like poems and lists.
Multiple lines will be concatenated into a single block provided:
- there is no empty line separating two lines
- the line does not start with a markdown symbol
  - `*`, `-`, or `+` for list items
  - `#` for headers
  - ~~`>` for blockquotes~~

Blocks may have attributes listed at the end of the block within brackets.
The following attributes are explicitly supported for text blocks:
- `{.dropcap}`: the first character will be a dropcap.
- `{.blockquote}`: the entire block will be treated as a blockquote.
- `{.center}`: the block will be centered.
- `{.right}`: the block will be aligned to the right.
- `{.list}`: lines will **not** be concatenated as usual.
- `{.verse}`: lines will not be concatenated, and spacing will be respected.
- `{.ed}` or `{.editor}`: the editor of the document.
- `{.sig}` or `{.signature}`: a signature line after a letter.
- `{.sit}`, `{.exh}` or `{.exhortation}`: the unnumbered line, often rendered
  in italics, at the beginning of prayers or letters that have been translated
  from eastern languages.
- `{.noid}`: a paragraph that does not receive a number.

Examples of the above may be found below:

**dropcap** {.noid}

**blockquote** {.noid}

**center** {.noid}

**right** {.noid}

**list** {.noid}

**verse** {.noid}

**editor** {.noid}

**signature** {.noid}

**exhortation** {.noid}

**noid** {.noid}

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes may be obtained in three ways:
1. ~~By prefixing each line of the blockquote with the > character. This is 
  standard markdown, and allows for the greatest portability. Nested
  blockquotes may be obtained by using multiple >> characters.~~
2. ~~By prefixing each line with four spaces. This looks better if one is reading
  the document in plain text as opposed to a markdown viewer, but in non-Ocean
  markdown such a block will appear as preformatted (fixed width) text. Nested
  blockquotes may be obtained by prefixing lines with eight spaces.~~
3. By appending the `{.blockquote}` attribute to the end of the block. This may
  be the easiest way to delineate blockquotes.


    O CHILDREN OF MEN! {.blockquote .sit}

    Know ye not why We created you all from the same dust? That no one should
    exalt himself over the other. Ponder at all times in your hearts how ye were
    created. Since we have created you all from one same substance, it is 
    incumbant on you to be even as one soul, to walk with the same feet, eat with
    the same mouth, and dwell in the same land... {.blockquote}

    Baha'u'llah {.blockquote .cite}
